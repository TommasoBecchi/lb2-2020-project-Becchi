# Predicting secondary structure of proteins: a comparison between GOR method and Support Vector Machines

One of the main biological problems is that of predicting the tertiary structure of a protein starting from the primary one. Nowadays the number of sequences is constantly increasing, while the number of tertiary structures is growing more slowly. 
The prediction of the secondary structure could help solve this problem: in this project, two methods for secondary structure prediction, GOR and SVM, are compared. For both methods, the training and the testing on a blind set are performed.
GOR and SVM methods were correctly implemented: using them it is possible to predict the secondary structure of a protein starting from the primary sequence. The two methods have a different three-class accuracy: 62% with GOR and 70% with SVM. Despite this evident accuracy difference, the differences between the parameters that describe the performance of the two methods in predicting the 3 different secondary structures are less clear.
